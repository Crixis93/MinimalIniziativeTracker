# Minimal Iniziative Tracker

This project is a very small Flutter application used to keep track of
creatures' initiatives during a tabletop session. Tap the `+` floating action
button to add a creature by name and initiative. Items in the list are ordered
from highest to lowest initiative.

To run the app make sure you have Flutter installed and execute:

```bash
flutter run
```
